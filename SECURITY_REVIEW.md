# Security Review - CacheOut

## Overview
This document summarizes the security review conducted on the CacheOut distributed compute marketplace, identifying and fixing all hardcoded credentials, fake data, and demo mode configurations.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Demo Mode Configuration
**Status: âœ… FIXED**

**Issues:**
- Backend config had demo mode settings enabled by default
- Scheduler had demo mode with fake job execution
- Hardcoded demo email addresses (`@demo.com`)

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed `DEMO_MODE`, `DEMO_SKIP_CREDITS`, `DEMO_SIMPLE_SCHEDULING` from config
- Removed all demo mode logic from scheduler
- Removed fake job execution and simulated output generation
- Changed email generation from `@demo.com` to `@cacheout.com`

### 2. Hardcoded Default Tokens
**Status: âœ… FIXED**

**Issues:**
- Backend config had insecure default admin token
- Frontend API calls used hardcoded test tokens
- Test files contained hardcoded tokens

**Fixes Applied:**
- Made `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable required (no default)
- Updated frontend to use environment variable for admin token
- Updated test files to use environment variables
- Made HTML test page require user input for admin token

### 3. Hardcoded Buyer IDs
**Status: âœ… FIXED**

**Issues:**
- Frontend components used hardcoded `"default-buyer"` ID
- Database initialization created hardcoded default buyer
- Test files used hardcoded buyer IDs

**Fixes Applied:**
- Made buyer ID configurable via `VITE_BUYER_ID` environment variable
- Updated database initialization to use generic sample users
- Updated test files to use configurable buyer IDs

### 4. Fake/Simulated Data Generation
**Status: âœ… FIXED**

**Issues:**
- Scheduler generated fake mining output with simulated hashrates
- Terminal component simulated fake connection status and hashrate updates
- Seller dashboard had mock task history
- Routes had simulated processing delays

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed all fake data generation from scheduler
- Made terminal display real job data only
- Removed mock task history from seller dashboard
- Removed simulated delays from API routes
- Made natural language processing return basic scripts instead of fake AI responses

### 5. Hardcoded Test Data
**Status: âœ… FIXED**

**Issues:**
- Test files contained hardcoded test tokens and IDs
- HTML test page had hardcoded admin token
- Integration tests used hardcoded credentials

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated all test files to use environment variables
- Made HTML test page require user input for admin token
- Updated integration tests to use proper environment configuration

## Security Improvements

### Environment Variable Requirements
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` is now required and has no default value
- `VITE_BUYER_ID` is configurable for frontend
- All sensitive configuration is environment-based

### Production-Ready Configuration
- Removed all demo mode settings
- Removed fake data generation
- Made system production-ready by default
- Proper error handling for missing environment variables

### API Security
- Admin token verification using Bearer token format
- Proper authorization headers required
- No hardcoded credentials in API calls

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/config.py` - Removed demo mode settings
- `backend/main.py` - Removed demo mode initialization
- `backend/scheduler.py` - Removed fake data generation and demo logic
- `backend/routes.py` - Removed simulated delays and fake responses
- `backend/init_db.py` - Removed hardcoded default buyer

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/BuyerDashboard.tsx` - Made buyer ID configurable
- `frontend/src/components/SellerDashboard.tsx` - Removed mock task history
- `frontend/src/components/Terminal.tsx` - Removed fake data simulation
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Updated to use environment variables

### Testing
- `testing/test_frontend_api.py` - Updated to use environment variables
- `testing/test_frontend.html` - Made admin token configurable
- `testing/test_integration.py` - Updated to use environment variables

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Backend
ADMIN_TOKEN=your_secure_admin_token_here

# Frontend (optional, has defaults)
VITE_BUYER_ID=sample-buyer
VITE_ADMIN_TOKEN=your_secure_admin_token_here
```

### .env File Location
Place the `.env` file at the root of the `CacheOut` directory.

## Recommendations

1. **Always use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
2. **Never commit credentials** to version control
3. **Use strong, unique tokens** for production deployments
4. **Regularly rotate admin tokens** for security
5. **Monitor logs** for unauthorized access attempts
6. **Use HTTPS** in production environments

## Conclusion

All hardcoded credentials, fake data, and demo mode configurations have been removed. The system is now production-ready with proper security practices in place. The application requires proper environment variable configuration and no longer contains any insecure defaults or fake data generation.
